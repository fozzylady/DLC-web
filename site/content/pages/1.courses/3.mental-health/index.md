<h3>A Starting Place for Students and Families</h3>

<p>Online learning may be an option for students who are experiencing mental health problems and are seeking different strategies for their learning.</p>

<ul class="fa-ul">
	<li>The flexible nature of our courses allows students to work from locations that are safe and comfortable.</li>
	<li>Support from our professional educators is personalized to each learner’s individual needs and delivered in a private, confidential way.</li>
	<li>Our experienced team of student support teachers understand mental health and are trained to help identify and address learning challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<section class="block-primary" style="width: 80%;margin: 0 auto;">
<p>Our mental health is as important as our physical health. We only have one brain and one body, so its our job to keep it running in the best way we can by paying attention to and working to improve our mental and physical health.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>



<p>A number of resources have been recommended by the Sun West School Division’s Positive Mental Health Committee and we would like to share them with you and your family.</p>

<p>We are committed to working with students and families to minimize stressors. Together, we can help make the online learning experience a positive one for all learners. Please reach out to our teachers for more information on strategies for success.</p>
