<h2>So many to choose from at every grade and learning level</h2>

<p>At the DLC, we offer a complete spectrum of <strong>core</strong> classes from Kindergarten to Grade 12, as well as a wide variety of interest-based <strong>electives</strong> at the high school level.</p>

<p>Every one of our online courses follows the Saskatchewan curriculum.</p>

<p>Each course is developed and delivered by a professional educator well versed in the unique dynamics of online learning.  Through email, Skype or face-to-face meetings, DLC teachers are available to offer both technical and instructional support, ensuring that learners are confident in their knowledge and well prepared to advance to the next level.</p>

<p>Our online information system, Moodle, allows students to access content at any time.</p>

<h2>At the DLC, learning happens in one of three ways.</h2>

<table class="table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<h3>Asynchronous</h3>

			<p>Asynchronous Asynchronous courses are the most flexible distance learning option. In an asynch course, learning happens independently, as students can log in and advance through course materials at any time. All asynch course materials – including course notes, pre-recorded videos and assessment tools – are hosted on Moodle making access simple and easy any time of day, any day of the week.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<h3>Synchronous</h3>

			<p>Synchronous courses are delivered online but in real time; an instructor teaches the course in a physical classroom and it is broadcast online to remote locations throughout Sun West School Divison. To ensure that learners can view the lesson as many times as they wish, each broadcast is recorded and made accessible on Moodle, along with class notes and related assignments, for future viewings.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<h3>Correspondence</h3>

			<p>Correspondence courses are provided in print-based packages that students can work through at their own pace. As with all DLC courses, instructors are available to provide support throughout the learning process.</p>
