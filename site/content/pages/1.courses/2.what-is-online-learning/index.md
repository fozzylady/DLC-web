<h2>So what do DLC courses look like?</h2>

<p>DLC courses are created specifically for an online learning environment.  Lesson plans, course notes, reading materials, instructional videos and assessment tools are developed by professional educators and are accessible for leaners of all ages.   Our web-based information management system, Moodle, houses each course and all relevant resources. </p>

<p>At the DLC, distance learning happens in one of three ways:</p>

<table class="table">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Asynchronous</p>

			<p>Asynchronous Asynchronous courses are the most flexible distance learning option. In an asynch course, learning happens independently, as students can log in and advance through course materials at any time. All asynch course materials – including course notes, pre-recorded videos and assessment tools – are hosted on Moodle making access simple and easy any time of day, any day of the week.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Synchronous</p>

			<p>Synchronous courses are delivered online but in real time; an instructor teaches the course in a physical classroom and it is broadcast online to remote locations throughout Sun West School Divison. To ensure that learners can view the lesson as many times as they wish, each broadcast is recorded and made accessible on Moodle, along with class notes and related assignments, for future viewings.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Correspondence</p>

			<p>Correspondence courses are provided in print-based packages that students can work through at their own pace. As with all DLC courses, instructors are available to provide support throughout the learning process.</p>

<h2>Who is there to support me?</h2>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.sunwestdlc.ca/pages/our-staff.html">team</a> of professional educators is there to provide guidance if and when learners need it. When you can confidently navigate the course and have little difficulty with course materials, you may require very little input or support from the instructor. When you wish to discuss the material in more detail or want further explanation, our instructors are there to provide as much guidance and clarity as you’d like.</p>

<p>To ensure that they can be reached when you need them, they respond to inquiries via email, Skype, or phone (during regular school hours) and will accommodate on-site meetings at the DLC upon request.</p>



<section class="block block-primary">
<h2>Are these courses available to me? What do they cost?</h2>

<p>Yes. We offer a full spectrum of Kindergarten to Grade 12 courses including all core and a wide variety of interest-based electives at the high school level.</p>

<p>Any Saskatchewan resident under the age of 22 has the option to register as a full-time online learner with the DLC and receive access to our courses free of charge.</p>

<p>Access is also available to learners who wish to enroll in one or more of our <a href="http://www.sunwestdlc.ca/courses.html">online courses</a> yet remain registered with their geographic division.  In that case, the resources provided and the learning experience will be the same however course fees will apply.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(97, 97, 97); font-size: 30px;">When can I register?</span></p>

<p>Learners can register for DLC courses <strong>at any point in the year</strong>.  Completing the registration process guarantees a spot in the course of interest and typically results in course access within 24-48 hours. </p>

<p>However, there are certain windows when teacher availability and/or course access is limited.  During these times access to online course materials will remain constant but the availability of educators for personalized supports or assignment feedback may be limited.</p>

<p>Teacher support is limited:</p>

<ul>
	<li>in the weeks immediately prior to the start and end of traditional school semester, and</li>
	<li>during the summer months.  </li>
</ul>
