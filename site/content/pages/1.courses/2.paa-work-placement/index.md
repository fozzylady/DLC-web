 <h2><strong>Considerations for </strong><strong>Non-Sun West Administrators</strong></h2>

<p><br />
For high school students registered as full-time with a division <strong><em>other than Sun West</em></strong> that want to enroll in a trades-based DLC elective <strong><em>with a work placement</em></strong>, a series of considerations must be addressed.  Doing so in a timely manner ensures that all of the necessary stakeholders are engaged in the conversation so the student can start learning as soon as possible. </p>

<p>For non-Sun West students, course fees for a typical high school elective are $500; however, for trades-based PAA courses that involve a work placement that will be handled by that student's home school division, this charge is discounted to reflect the home division’s support around finding and doing the site visits for the work placement.  </p>

<p>The chart below indicates the variable course fees and proportion of theory and work placement time depending on the Grade level of the course: </p>

<p>For non-Sun West Administrators, we encourage you to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>- It is recommended the division have policies and procedures in place for off-site, work-based learning opportunities for students. </li>
	<li>- Work placements must be <strong>arranged</strong> and <strong>supervised</strong> by a teacher in their division.   </li>
	<li>- It is also recommended the teacher conduct a minimum of two on-site visitations within the first 25 hours of work-based learning and at least one on-site visitation for each additional 25 hours. </li>
	<li>- The DLC can provide assessment tools to guide the teacher, supervisor and/or the business owner/manager through the work placement; to be employed at the division’s discretion. </li>
	<li>- When it is an option, we recommend a work placement at all levels.  However, if it better suits the learner, 10 level courses can be completed <strong>without</strong> the work placement.   In this case, the full course fee of $500 would apply.   </li>
</ul>

<p>We strive to accommodate the policies and procedures of our partner School Divisions as they pertain to off-site work placements.  If/when these provisions do not exist or they contradict those of Sun West, additional discussion is required.  </p>

<p>Contact Kurtis Heath at 306.252.1000 or <a href="mailto:kurtis.heath@sunwestsd.ca">kurtis.heath@sunwestsd.ca</a> to further explore this option. </p>

<ul>
	<li>- We recommend a work placement at all levels, however, if it better suits the learner, 10 level courses can be completed without the work placement. </li>
	<li>- Because they need to be supervised by a teacher, work placements must be completed at a business located within Sun West borders.</li>
