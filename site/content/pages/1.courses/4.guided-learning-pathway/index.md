<p>For some of our students, they appreciate the opportunity to set their own timeline and learning goals, working at their own pace. But for others, this is a stressful part of learning and they would benefit from additional structure and supports to help keep them on track.</p>

<p>New in 2017, we have introduced a Guided Learning Pathway to support our online learners. For learners who opt to follow our guided learning path, DLC course materials will remain accessible 24 hours a day and teachers continue to play an integral role.</p>

<h3>However, we’ve added for their benefit:</h3>

<p>scheduled due dates for assignments and exams, and </p>

<p>more frequent communication about upcoming due dates, progress towards completion goals and helpful tips for keeping on track.   </p>

<p>Guided learners will be able to work ahead of the given timeline, however, if unable to meet a due date, they are instructed to communicate that to the teacher - along with a plan for submitting that assignment - prior to the designated due date.   </p>
