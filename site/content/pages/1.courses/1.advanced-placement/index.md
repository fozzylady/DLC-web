<h3>How is learning different within the AP environment?</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An AP courses, the focus is not on memorizing and regurgitating facts and figures. Instead, students engage in intense discussions, solve problems collaboratively, and learn to write clearly and persuasively. This can be especially challenging in an online environment.

	<li>have parental support and approval</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How does AP affect high school and university credits?</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completed courses will be noted on Ministry-issued high school transcripts with an AP designation (ex. ELA B30 AP).</p>

<blockquote style="background:#FFC62F;padding:12px;">
<p>Note: Ministry of Education transcripts will indicate the AP Designation as received from Kenaston School as the DLC is working in tandem with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AP students are evaluated on a scale of 1-5.&nbsp; &nbsp;A score of 2 or 3 indicates significant success; this student is well equipped for intense academic study and better prepared for a post-secondary learning environment.&nbsp; A score of 4 or 5 - on most AP exams - will earn a university credit or placement; certain programs will also recognize an AP score of 3.&nbsp; It is crucial for you to check with the university of your choice to see what score is required to obtain the credit.&nbsp; It is also important to note that you have the option to accept or not accept the university credit.&nbsp; In declining the university credit, you would have the option to retake the course in university and work towards a higher mark.</p>

<h3>When and where do I write an AP exam?</h3>

<p>In May, students write an AP exam which is developed by the College Board; the international agency that certifies and monitors AP course deliveries. The annual schedule of AP exams is posted well in advance.</p>

<p>These exams are proctored by appointed supervisors and <strong>must be written at a designated AP School</strong>. Following registration, your instructor will discuss with you appropriate schools that you can write at.</p>

<p><a class="btn" href="http://apcanada.collegeboard.org/participating-schools" target="_blank">AP Designated Schools</a></p>

<h3>Are there any important dates I should be aware of?</h3>

<p>The deadline for AP registration is Friday September 9th, 2016.</p>

<p>Unlike most DLC courses, AP courses are not continuous intake; assignment due dates are set to keep students on track and ensure readiness for the AP Exam, which all AP students across the country write, in May.</p>

<p>There is a non-refundable fee of $94&nbsp;USD per exam. Monies are to be paid immediately after registration in the course.</p>

<h3>What if I find AP is not for me after I register?</h3>

If this is the case, meet with your teacher to explore alternate pathways to obtain the associated Saskatchewan curricular outcomes. There are always other options. If you have paid for the AP course, you can discuss the possibility of a refund with the DLC Administration.</p>

<h3>Who is the DLC AP Coordinator?</h3>

<p>The DLC AP Coordinator is Aaron Biberdorf. It is the AP Coordinator's responsibility to apply for accommodations, order AP Exams, and assign invigilators. You should contact your instructor(s) directly with questions about AP programming.</p>
