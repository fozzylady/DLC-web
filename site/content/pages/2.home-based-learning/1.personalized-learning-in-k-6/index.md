<h2><span style="color:#ffb10a;">Empowering</span> elementary students with<br />
personalized learning pathways…</h2>

<p>The concept of the DLC grew out of the belief that every learner is unique and – for any number of reasons – may be seeking to learn in ways that are different from the experiences in a traditional school.  Our school was created to offer choice to these learners.</p>

<p>For 10 years, we’ve been developing online courses, providing instruction and supporting learners as they navigate those courses at a pace that suits them.  We have found this to be a great fit for many, especially for those families that want ready-to-go lesson plans and structured learning within a home-based environment.  This form of support will continue to be available to those who seek it. </p>

<p>But, we’ve come to realize that model is not a fit for everyone. When mom and/or dad have chosen to be an active and regular part of their child’s learning, they often wish to incorporate other educational resources – kits, workbooks, lesson plans – into the mix and may even assume responsibility for evaluation and assessment. </p>

<h3>A Successful Pilot Project</h3>

<p><em>From September 2016 to June 2017, we conducted a pilot project with 10 home-based families.  Each had their own reasons for pursing home-based learning and each had a personalized learning plan that accommodated their unique situation.  The ages, maturity levels and capacities of the learners varied greatly, as did the degree of parental involvement.  </em></p>

<p><em>We explored different ways that we, as a staff at the DLC could support that family regardless of what resources they chose to use or what pace they needed to work at. </em></p>

<p><em>And the lessons we learned, triggered an evolution.  </em></p>

<p><a class="btn btn-info" href="http://www.sunwestpebl.ca/what.html">personalized learning</a></p>

<p>This phenomenon is being practised by educational leaders around the globe and we’ve figured out how we can apply this concept to our school – and bring it into your home - too. </p>

        <div class="box"><h2>Personalized learning means that students have <span style="color:#ffb10a;">voice</span> and <span style="color:#ffb10a;">choice</span>.</h2>

<p>Voice in determining with what tools and at what pace they learn.  Choice in the way they demonstrate their learning and show evidence that they've met - or mastered - curricular outcomes.
This freedom can foster great academic and personal success and we see our role as enabling, co-creating and supporting you and your learner regardless of which educational pathway you take.</p>

<h2>We think of learning on a <span style="color:#ffb10a;">spectrum</span>. </h2>

<p>That spectrum accommodates learning that is structured and flexible, accelerated and extended, heavily dependent on DLC instructors and primarily guided by students and their mentors. </p>

<p>Where you fall on this spectrum might vary subject to subject or year to year...and that's OK.  There is room for every type of learner that wants to set academic goals and work to achieve them. </p>

<p><img alt="" src="/assets/img/PLP-graphic-v2(1).png" style="width: 100%;" /></p>
 

<h2>But that freedom also comes with a healthy dose of <span style="color:#ffb10a;">responsibility</span>. </h2>

<p>To help you make decisions and build a plan that best suits your learner’s needs, we encourage your family to consider several critical factors:</p>
