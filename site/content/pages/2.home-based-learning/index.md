<p>Educating a child from home is the ideal arrangement for some families and learners. With quality educational resources and a willing parent or mentor to support the learning experience, children can not only grow but prosper from Kindergarten through to high school graduation in this nurturing environment.</p>

<p>At the DLC, we see ourselves as partners in this journey. Our online courses, which include K-12 lesson plans, reading materials, workbooks, instructional videos, and online assessment tools, are developed by professional educators with the express purpose of facilitating learning in a remote location. Those same educators are also readily available to support the learner – and in the case of a young learner, the learning mentor – throughout the educational process. Through email, Skype, phone and, if convenient, face to face meetings, our instructors can help develop alternate ways to explore issues, creatively solve problems and prepare leaners for subsequent steps on their educational path.</p>

<h2>What is a learning mentor?</h2>

<p>A home-based learning mentor is any adult who is responsible for the learning instruction and support in the home. It is not always possible for the parent to be the learning mentor. A mentor person may be a parent, guardian, relative, friend, or tutor. Mentors, learners and online instructors work as a team to help learners successfully complete their online courses.</p>

<h2>What does a mentor do?</h2>
There is a misconception that online learners may not have the same learning supports as their peers in a traditional school setting. However, home-based learners benefit from the personal attention of a learning mentor who can provide daily encouragement and support in a way that meets a learner's individual needs. While the role of the learning mentor may be slightly different as a student progresses from elementary to high school, an effective mentor is key to student success in an online environment. To learn more about the role of a mentor, check out our Sun West DLC <a href="/assets/files/Learning-Mentor-Guide-(comp).pdf">Learning Mentor Guide.</a></div>

<h2>What technology is required in a home-based learning environment?</h2>

<p>To ensure the timely completion of courses, learners should have <strong>regular access to a device such as a computer, tablet, or Smartphone and reliable Internet service. </strong> If you do not have a computer or Internet in the home, inquire at the local library or other public venues about their options.</p>
