title: Biology 30
description: |
  Through the study of living things, learners will begin to understand and appreciate the vastness of our world. They will explore how all living things demonstrate a base level of similarity and, conversely, the ways they are unique. They will study how living things obtain energy, utilize nutrients and transport substances within their structure.
  
  Biology 30 also dives into the concepts of genetics, cell structure and function, the diversity of life - at the cellular and organ system levels â€“ as well as looking at evolution.
