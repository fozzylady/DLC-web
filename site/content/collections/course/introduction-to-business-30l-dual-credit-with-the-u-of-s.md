  <ul>
  <li>This course follows the U of S schedule which is not aligned with traditional high school schedule.</li>
  <li>There are extra fees (tuition for the U of S) associated with this course; there are NO fees charged by&nbsp;the DLC. &nbsp;So, if you get an automatically generated DLC invoice stating that you owe $500, please ignore it.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  
  <h3>DLC Role vs. U of S Role</h3>
  
  <p>A dedicated Sun West DLC teacher will&nbsp;support&nbsp;students through the registration process, help&nbsp;to resolve issues that arise throughout the course and serve&nbsp;as a liaison between the student/parent and the post-secondary institution.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>A U of S instructor&nbsp;will provide all instruction, clarify content, and conduct assessments.</p>
  
  <section class="block-secondary">
  <h3 style="color:#fff;">Registration Process</h3>
  
  <p>Phone (306) 252-1000 or <a href="https://www.sunwestdlc.ca/pages/registration-message.html">register online</a> with the DLC and ensure your high school credit is properly awarded.</p>
  
  <p>Upon completion of that process, we will email you the necessary form to register with the U of S. This document will advise of all necessary U of S deadlines and fees.</p>

  <p>If you have questions regarding the U of S registration process, email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:admissions@usask.ca?subject=DLC%20registration%20Business%2030">admissions@usask.ca</a>&nbsp;or call (306) 966-6718.</p>
  
  <p>Once your application is processed, the U of S will email notification to you and payment&nbsp;will be&nbsp;due&nbsp;immediately. &nbsp; Your&nbsp;admission letter will provide the credentials needed to access your U of S student account (PAWS) where you can learn about outstanding fees and&nbsp;payment options. &nbsp;</p>
