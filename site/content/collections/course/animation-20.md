title: Animation 20L
description: |
  Developed by Vancouver Animation School (VANAS), this course showcases why and how animators play such an important role in the animation, visual effects and video game industries. An animator's mission is to bring the illusion of life to animated characters, to connect with the audience, and to make people believe. With Disney and Pixar animators providing the instruction, students will explore 3D character computer animation, bringing life to a cast of characters, all in their own personal style.

  Learners will be create an online portfolio of their learning, which will include artifacts created throughout the course. Not only does this portfolio allow an animator to showcase their work, it will be a valuable asset when applying to post-secondary institutions and when job seeking in this field.

  Successful students will have the opportunity to use this course as a dual credit, meaning it simultaneously earns them high school and post-secondary credits, if they choose to pursue further education with VANAS or any of their partner institutions.
