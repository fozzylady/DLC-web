title: Calculus 30
description: |
  Learners will bring together knowledge from previous math courses and expand upon it in the discovery of derivatives and integrals. By the end of the course, learners will know how to determine derivatives of many kinds of functions and how use those calculations to solve “real world” problems that pertain to velocity, acceleration and optimization problems. They will also study the opposite function – integrals – and explore how they can be used to determine the area under or between curves.
  
  The course is a great preview for those that will be required to take a university-level calculus course; many engineering colleges require that this course be completed prior to entering.
