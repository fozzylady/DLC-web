  <p><b>Important:&nbsp;</b></p>
  
  <p>This course requires tuition to be paid by the student (explained below) as well as the possibility of extra fees for course resources (textbooks, etc).</p>
  
  <p>For a course description as well as course start and end dates, please see the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://saskpolytech.ca/admissions/resources/dual-credit.aspx">Saskatchewan Polytechnic Dual Credit Page</a>.</strong></p>
  
  <p>As this course is offered directly from Saskatchewan Polytechnic, and not Sun West, there is a different registration process.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>If you want to take this course, and have read the course description and understand the fees associated with this course, then&nbsp;<strong>register for this course through the DLC online clicking the Registration button below (or at the top of our website).</strong><br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Once we receive your information, you will be contacted via email with other important information via email,&nbsp;<strong>as well as instructions on registering directly with Sask Polytech</strong>. &nbsp;It is incredibly important that you register through our site first so that you can recieve a high school credit.<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Once the student registers with Sask Polytech and pays them for the course, the student needs to inform the DLC.<br>
  &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Sask&nbsp;Polytechnic will send the student information (by email) with course access and other course information (information about course resources, etc).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Please note that students outside of the Sun West School Division will not be paying the usual $550 to Sun West as advertised on other pages of the DLC website. &nbsp;The only fees involved for this&nbsp;course are those that go to Sask Polytechnic, which are paid directly by the student. &nbsp;If an invoice happens to come, please ignore it for this course.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Also note that Mr. Biberdorf is not the instructor of this course, but will act as a liason between the student and/or parents and Sask Polytechnic.</p>
  
  <p>For the record, here is Sask Polytechnic's refund policy (subject to change at any moment):</p>
  
  <p><strong>If a student unenrolls from a course within&nbsp;14 days past the course start date the student will be refunded for the course EXCEPT for a $105 administration fee.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>If a student unenrolls from a course past 14 days pas the course start date there will be no refund.</strong></p>
