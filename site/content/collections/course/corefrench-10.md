pre_requisite: >
   While there is no formal pre-requisite for Core French 10, there is an expectation that learners
  have mastered basic reading, writing, speaking and listening skills in French. Before gaining access
  to the course, learners will be required to complete a language level assessment to determine
  readiness. This assessment will ensure that learners have the necessary skills to be successful in
  the course.

  Core French 10 introduces learners to Francophone cultures and expands their knowledge of the language in both oral and written form. We will practice reading, writing, representing, speaking
  and listening in French, using a variety of hands-on, activity-based exercises.
  
  Throughout the three units of study, learners study the required French vocabulary and sentence structure to understand advertising in a retail environment, plan a trip, and explore a driver’s license. All of these skills will come together in a final project that will showcase the learner’s appreciation of the French language and culture.
