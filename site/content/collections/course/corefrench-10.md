  Core French 10 introduces learners to Francophone cultures and expands their knowledge of the
  language in both oral and written form. We will practice reading, writing, representing, speaking
  and listening in French, using a variety of hands-on, activity-based exercises.

  Throughout the three units of study, learners study the required French vocabulary and sentence
  structure to understand advertising in a retail environment, plan a trip, and explore a driver’s
  license. All of these skills will come together in a final project that will showcase the
  learner’s appreciation of the French language and culture.
