description: |
  <P>Building on the concepts studied in Science 9, learners will strengthen their knowledge of the atoms and elements, and use those principals in chemical reactions. They will explore climate and ecosystems, where they will study climate, life, and biogeochemical cycles that impact our world and the biomes around us. Students will examine the forces that act on objects and how they affect their motions.<P>
  
  <p>Learners will develop scientific literacy through a combination of the science-related attitudes, skills, and knowledge students need to develop inquiry, problem-solving, and decision-making abilities; to become lifelong learners, and maintain a sense of wonder about the world around them.</p>
