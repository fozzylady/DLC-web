delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
pre_requisite: Math Pre-Calculus 20
description: |
  This course is intended for learners who are continuing their study in high level mathematics.
  
  Pre-Calculus 30 focuses primarily on graphs of various functions and guides the learner in determining the characteristics of each graph by looking at the equation. Each chapter will explore different types of graphs, study how the graph can be transformed by changing the numbers and solving equations of that type.
  
  Topics in this course include graphing functions such as polynomial, radical, trigonometric, logarithm, exponential and rational functions. The course will also dive into dome advanced trigonometry including unit circles, secondary trig ratios, and identities.
units_of_study:
  - Transformations of Graphs
  - Graphing Functions â€“ polynomial, radical, exponential, logarithmic
  - Trig functions and their graphs
  - Identities
  - Composite Functions
