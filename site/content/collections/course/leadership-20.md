  Learners will develop leadership skills that will prepare them for the 21st century. Along with
  these skills, students will analyze and research in the areas of meetings, volunteering, leaders
  throughout history, and human behaviour. They will participate in personality testing which will
  allow them to see who they are as learners and leaders, and how they can work in groups with other
  personalities. Learners have the potential to become successful leaders through hands on
  application, mentorship, inquiry, and project-based learning. This course will provide students with
  a solid foundation for life, work and citizenship.
