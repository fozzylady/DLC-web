  This course has a required work placement component (75 hours theory and 25 hours of work placement).  The work placement must be coordinated through a Career Work Exploration (CWEX) teacher (ask your principal if you do not know if you have a CWEX teacher available). Students are responsible for any necessary workplace attire/materials (ex. work boots, tools, etc).
  
  For Practical and Applied Arts courses with a work placement, additional fees and scheduled site visits may be required. We encourage all learners, parents, mentors and, where appropriate, school-based administrators to familiarize themselves with our <a href="/courses/paa-work-placement">work placement policies</a>.
