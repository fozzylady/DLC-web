  Creative Writing 20 delves into four unique genres of creative prose: fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and script writing. In this course, learners read, dissect, and compose literature in each genre.  They will learn to identify the elements of each form and throughout the assignments, will be asked to apply this knowledge and produce original pieces of creative writing.
  
  Throughout the course, learners will explore their own creative tendencies and strengthen their individual writing styles, resulting in a more confident and experienced writer.
  
  There is no final exam. After completing each of the modules, learners work on refining their own written pieces which become part of their final portfolio.  Not only does this portfolio will allow a writer to showcase their written work, it will be a valuable asset if pursuing a writing career in the future.
