description: |
  Cow/Calf 30 is a part of the PAA curriculum and focuses on Beef Support Systems. The course consists of 30-40 assignments, a Resource Binder final project, and hands-on skills.
  
  Learners in our agriculture courses will complete the OATS farm safety online program, developed by the Saskatchewan Safety Council.
  
  Learners will prepare videos as they demonstrate skills from the course. Access to cattle and livestock facilities is necessary. Due to the seasonal nature of this course, we suggest that learners who register for Semester 1 allow all year for the course.
