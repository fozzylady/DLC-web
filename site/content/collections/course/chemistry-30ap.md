title: Advanced Placement Chemistry 30
pre_requisite: 'Physical Science 20 (Math Pre-Calculus 20 - highly recommended)'
description: |
  The Chemistry 30 AP course provides students with a college-level foundation to support future advanced course work in chemistry, as well as fulfilling the credit requirements for the Chemistry 30 course mandated by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Learning. Furthermore, the secondary goal of AP Chemistry 30 is to prepare students for the AP Chemistry exam.
  
  Students cultivate their understanding of chemistry through inquiry-based investigations, both virtual and hands on, as they explore topics such as:
  atomic structure, intermolecular forces and bonding, chemical reactions, kinetics, thermodynamics, and equilibrium.
  
  Students will be expected to understand, apply and critically think about chemistry concepts prevented in the course content.
