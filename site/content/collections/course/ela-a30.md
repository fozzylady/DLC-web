pre_requisite: ELA 20
description: |
  ELA A30 is an exploration of Canada’s past and present through literary sources. Learners will be studying the complex Canadian identity and experience through news articles, short stories, poetry, novel, essays and editorials. This course is designed to challenge the idea of what it means to be Canadian and put a spotlight on different experiences of Canada. This is an excellent course to take alongside History 30.
  
  Learners work on refining their own written pieces which become part of their final portfolio, showcased in a phone interview given by the instructor. The portfolio and exit interview allow the students to showcase their work, reflect on their growth and goals, and have a meaningful conversation with their course instructor.
