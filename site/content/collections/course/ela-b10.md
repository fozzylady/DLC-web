description: |
  Learners will explore the overarching themes of equality and diversity. As they read a variety of short stories, poems, plays, and novels, students will examine their views of justice and fairness, rights and responsibilities, and the diversity of individuals and communities. Throughout the course, they will also strengthen and build confidence in their own creative skills as they create original visual, multimedia, oral and written texts.
  
  Learners will prepare a final portfolio that they will present to their instructor during a scheduled exit interview. This experience will allow the learners to showcase their work and reflect on their growth and goals.
