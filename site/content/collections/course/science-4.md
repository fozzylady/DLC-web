  interrelationships among science, technology, society, and the environment that will affect their
  personal lives, their careers, and their future. Lesson plans include written instruction,
  instructional videos, handouts, and assessment tools. Learners will inquire, explore, and experiment
  to complete lessons and projects. Assessment will include ongoing home assessments and regular
