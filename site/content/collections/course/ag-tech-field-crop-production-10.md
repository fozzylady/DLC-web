  Due to the seasonal nature of this course, we recommend that students registering during Semester 1 opt to take this course for the full school year.
  
  Field Crop 10 is part of the PAA curriculum. Field Crop 10 focuses on Field Crop Operation and Care, and covers topics such as Soil Sampling, Maintaining and Operating Harvesting Equipment, Sample Collection Methods and Interpersonal and Communication skills. The course consists of 30-40 assignments that are hosted in Moodle, a Resource Binder final project, and performing hands-on skills from the course.
  
  Students also need to prepare videos of the course skills they will need to demonstrate and submit to their instructor. Students will need access to machinery and facilities for the skill demonstrations. These are homework assignments.
