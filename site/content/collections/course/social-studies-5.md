  Social Studies is a required area of study in Saskatchewanâ€™s Curriculum. Learners will develop an understanding of the connections of people to Canada. The purpose of social studies is to help learners know and appreciate the past, understand the present, influence the future, and make connections between events and issues of the past, the present, and the future. Social Studies education is the study of people and their relationships with the world around them. The Social Studies program provides opportunity for learners to develop a sense of themselves as active participants in their world (personal, local, national, and global). They are encouraged to make connections to their own lives as they learn. Lesson plans include written instruction, instructional videos, handouts and assessment tools. Learners will complete lessons and projects by researching, interviewing and connecting. Assessment will include ongoing home assessments and regular submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents, audio and video files, photos of projects.
