  ELA 20 focuses on the guiding theme of “Looking Back, Looking Forward”. Learners will read an assortment of literary texts, and explore the idea of looking back into childhood and looking forward into the future. They will explore a variety of texts such as short stories, poems, plays, novels, essays and articles, and be exposed to diverse voices and perspectives throughout these pieces of writing. Learners will also strengthen their own skills and build confidence in their voices as they create a range of visual, multimedia, oral and written texts throughout the course.
  
  Learners will prepare a final portfolio presented to their instructor during a phone interview. The portfolio and exit interview allow the students to showcase their work, reflect on their growth and goals, and have a meaningful conversation with their course instructor.
