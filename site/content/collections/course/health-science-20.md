  This course will challenge students to look at the health science field from holistic and analytic perspectives to provide a basis for making sound personal health choices. Students will apply information in the areas of medical knowledge systems and ethics, human anatomy and physiology, nutrition and metabolism, and medical diagnostics. Understanding the basic anatomy and physiology of the human body will provide a context for studying the normal and abnormal functioning of various body systems and the tools and techniques used to diagnose those systems. Students will also investigate the range of health science careers and post-secondary programs available in Saskatchewan.
