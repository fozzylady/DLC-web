Students will learn basic theory on building layouts, floor and wall framing, and foundations. This 45-50 hour theory component is combined with a 50- 55 hour work study. The work study component is set up with the school Career and Work Exploration Teacher and provides the student with hands on experience in the carpentry and construction industry.
