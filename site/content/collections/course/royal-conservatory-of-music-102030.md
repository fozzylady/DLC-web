  <p>If you are a music student and are working towards your RCM Certificates, you may be eligible to receive one credit in each of Grades 10, 11 and 12.&nbsp; These are listed as Royal Conservatory of Music credits and will appear on your Ministry of Education high school transcript.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>Students must complete the RCM examinations&nbsp;as listed in the chart below&nbsp;and then provide the RCM transcript to the high school that they are currently attending.&nbsp; The transcript will be sent to the Ministry of Education for evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>The RCM Certificate Program is a comprehensive and effectively sequenced system of music study and standard of assessment&nbsp;that provides a clear path for well-rounded musical training. &nbsp;&nbsp;From beginner to advanced levels, the program offers&nbsp;consistent and meaningful structure for recognizing achievement&nbsp;and rewarding excellence. &nbsp;Students attain a level of musical proficiency necessary to&nbsp;learn music independently which is intended to facilitate a&nbsp;lifelong enjoyment of music-making.</p>
  
  <p>The Certificate Program enables students to progress at their own pace and move freely through the system.&nbsp; At each level of study, a Certificate of Achievement can be earned by successfully completing a Royal Conservatory practical examination.&nbsp; Achievement in Royal Conservatory examinations is recognized for credit toward secondary school graduation in many schools systems across Canada&nbsp;and is an important element in entrance requirements for professional music programs at many universities and colleges across North America.</p>
