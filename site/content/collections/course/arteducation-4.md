title: Arts Education 4
description: >
  | Arts Education is an area of study in Saskatchewan’s Core Curriculum. The aim of this course is
  to help learners understand and value arts expressions throughout life. The focus for grade 3 is
  Saskatchewan. You will be able to make connections with other curriculums and develop a deeper
  understanding. The learners in this course will require a Learning Mentor to help them navigate the
  lesson plans, instructional videos and course assessments. Assessments will include ongoing home
  assessment and regular submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents, audio
  and video files, photos of projects. We are flexible and through regular communication we are
  willing to support families to fit the learner’s voice and choice.
