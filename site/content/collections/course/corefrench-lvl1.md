  beginning level for Core French study, regardless of the actual grade level of learners.

  Core French Level 1 introduces learners to the very basics of the French language. The focus will be
  on becoming familiar with spoken characteristics of the language through a variety of hands-on,
  theme-based listening and speaking activities. Throughout the eight units of study, learners will
  learn theme-based vocabulary and sentence structure to better understand, use, and appreciate the
  French language and cultures.
