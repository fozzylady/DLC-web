  Canadian household debt has reached nearly 170%, making Canada one of the ten highest household debt nations! In Personal Finance 30L, we will develop the knowledge and skills to manage our own finances and avoid becoming part of this statistic.
  
  Learners will take an active role in their own personal finances, with the aim of providing them a broad base of knowledge and skills related to personal financial management. Throughout the course, learners will explore personal savings plans, credit, and financial institutions, as they create a financial literacy foundation. Building upon this foundation, learners will examine the economy, its impact on personal finances, and some decision-making strategies to help implement the personal savings plan within that economy. Additionally, learners will explore taxation, investing, risk and fraud, as well as, purchasing, renting and leasing, broadening their personal financial skills.
  
  Learners will maintain a personal savings plan, also known as a budget, throughout the course, adding to it as we develop new skills and knowledge. Learners will also complete major income tax and investing projects. Finally, in Personal Finance 30L we will make use of case studies, regularly applying new knowledge in real-world scenarios.
