description: |
  <P>Chemistry 30 builds on what was learned in Chemistry 20â€¦ and then some! We begin with a review of Chemistry 20 and then quickly move into one of the more common themes in this course, solutions and solubility. We then briefly look at thermodynamics and rates of reactions. The course concludes with an in depth look at equilibrium, acids and bases, and finally electrochemistry.</p>
  
  <p>This course has an open book departmental and comes with a resource package with all reference sheets needed for assignments and exams, like the periodic table and solubility curves.</p>
  
  <p>Note - Final Exams will require supervision.Details will follow from your instructor if you choose to register.</p>
