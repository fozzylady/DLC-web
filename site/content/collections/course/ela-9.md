  ELA 9 is delivered online through PDF, Video and Audio resources. Learners are exposed to literary
  content to gain understanding of self, community, history, emotions, and social interactions. They
  study this content and learn how to communicate their understanding through visual, written, and
  oral formats in both direct and abstract manners.

  During the course, learners work on refining their own written pieces which become part of their
  final portfolio, showcased in a final reflection assignment. The portfolio allows the students to
  showcase their work, reflect on their growth and goals for their ELA courses to come.
