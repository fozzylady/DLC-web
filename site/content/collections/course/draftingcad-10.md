delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
description: 'Drafting & CAD 10 is an introductory course well suited to learners who love to design and engineer. In this course, we will introduce basic terminology and concepts around computer aided-design and start creating basic mechanical drawings. Learners will explore dimensioning and come to understand how to measure and visually represent an object proportionately and to scale. With drafting software, we will apply that knowledge, transforming a 3D object into a 2D object and vice versa.'
