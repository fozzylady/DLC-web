  History 10 explores how our modern, industrialized, democratic societies came to be. We will examine the changes in European society and culture from the mid-18th century to World War I that have shaped today's western worldview. The French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the rise of nationalism and liberalism, and the Age of the New Imperialism are some of the historic events and movements that will illustrate these changes.
  
  Throughout their studies, learners will also come to understand how worldview shapes world events and influences political and economic decision-making in the past and present.
