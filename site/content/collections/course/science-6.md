  Science is a required area of study in Saskatchewanâ€™s Curriculum. The aim of the curriculum is to
  help all Saskatchewan students to develop scientific literacy. The course provides learners with
  many opportunities to explore, analyze, evaluate, synthesize, appreciate and understand the
  interrelationships among science, technology, society, and the environment that will affect their
  personal lives, their careers, and their future. Lesson plans include written instruction,
  instructional videos, handouts, and assessment tools. Learners will inquire, explore, and experiment
  to complete lessons and projects. Assessment will include ongoing home assessments and regular
  submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents, audio and video files,
