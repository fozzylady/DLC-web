  Learners will dig deeply into Canada’s history, focusing in on the story of our Indigenous peoples. They will explore Canada’s inconvenient truths around nation-building, social stereotypes, and the prevalent myths concerning Aboriginal peoples. Learners will trace political and social activism as demonstrated by a host of prominent people from decorated war veterans to the leaders of highly prosperous and self-governing nations. Knowing the causes and effects of shifting relationships, power, and authority will prepare learners to better understand the present day challenges facing Indigenous peoples, and grow their understanding of the circumstances today that are renewing and moving that relationship forward.
  
  The course will invite learners to demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways; to pose questions and make real-world connections with the content.
