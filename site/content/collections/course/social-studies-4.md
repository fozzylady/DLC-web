description: >
  Social Studies is a required area of study in Saskatchewanâ€™s Curriculum. Learners will develop an
  understanding of the connections of people to land. The purpose of Social Studies is to help
  learners know and appreciate the past, understand the present, influence the future, and make
  connections between events and issues of the past, the present, and the future. Social Studies
  education is the study of people and their relationships with the world around them. The Social
  Studies program provides opportunity for learners to develop a sense of themselves as active
  participants in their world (personal, local, national, and global). They are encouraged to make
  connections to their own lives as they learn. Lesson plans include written instruction,
  instructional videos, handouts and assessment tools. Learners will complete lessons and projects by
  researching, interviewing and connecting. Assessment will include ongoing home assessments and
  regular submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents, audio and video
  files, photos of projects.
