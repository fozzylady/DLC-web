description: ""
0: >
  The Core French Curriculum is created by language levels and not by grade levels. Level 2 is the
  beginning level for Core French study, regardless of the actual grade level of learners.
1: >
  Core French Level 2 allows learners to build on what they learned in Core French Level 1 and become
  more comfortable with the French language. The focus will be on building a basic sentence and
  learners will learn reading and writing strategies in French. Throughout the eight units of study,
  learners will learn theme-based vocabulary and sentence structure in both spoken and written forms
  so that they may better understand, use, and appreciate the French language and cultures.
