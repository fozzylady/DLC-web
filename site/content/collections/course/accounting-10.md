  Accounting 10 introduces the role and responsibilities of an accountant in a service business. Learners will be introduced to the basic definitions and concepts, as well as foundational information like the accounting equation and transaction entries. They will also become familiar with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Accounting Standards for Private Enterprise (ASPE), which inform and guide accounting practices.
  
  Learners will also examine how service businesses, organized as a sole proprietorship, record, process, analyze, and present financial information. As part of this examination, they will look at different cash controls and how a business ensures the legitimacy of the data and financial records it maintains. Finally, we will prepare a set of financial statements and explore how these documents are used to make informed business decisions.
