description: >
  Social Studies is a required area of study in Saskatchewanâ€™s Curriculum. Learners will develop an
  understanding of the interdependence of people in countries that border the Atlantic Ocean. The
  purpose of social studies is to help learners know and appreciate the past, understand the present,
  influence the future, and make connections between events and issues of the past, the present, and
  the future. Social Studies education is the study of people and their relationships with the world
  around them. The Social Studies program provides opportunity for learners to develop a sense of
  themselves as active participants in their world (personal, local, national, and global). They are
  encouraged to make connections to their own lives as they learn. Lesson plans include written
  instruction, instructional videos, handouts and assessment tools. Learners will complete lessons and
  projects by researching, interviewing and connecting. Assessment will include ongoing home
  assessments and regular submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents,
  audio and video files, photos of projects.
