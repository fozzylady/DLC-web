  <P>Science 9 builds on understandings from previous grade levels for learners to understand the world around them, from the atomic level to their own bodies to the scale of the universe. Learners develop their communication skills through making connections and sharing their findings in an organized manner, in addition to applying observation and problem solving skills. Through assigned readings, videos, and labs/activities, learners will have the opportunity to not only explore the world we cannot directly observe without the use of technology, but also to assess our impact upon our world, ourselves, and beyond.</p>
  
  <p>Each unit will have either a unit exam or a final unit project. Learners are expected to maintain a science journal in addition to their regular notes and assignments as they explore the fields of life science, chemistry, physical science, and astronomy. They will also be opportunities to engage in science challenges, including making connections to current events and collaborating with peers.</p>
