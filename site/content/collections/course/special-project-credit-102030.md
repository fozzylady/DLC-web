  <p>Have you ever said, “I wish there was a course in …”? Do you have interests in areas you can’t currently pursue at your school? If this is the case, then a Special Project Credit (SPC) is the way to go. SPCs reflect learning and skill development that occur in a learner’s life through a multitude of programs and experiences (i.e clubs, sports, training, etc.). This unique credit is individualized and designed by the learner and overseen by a qualified project mentor (typically a coach or instructor) and a designated teacher mentor. For more information about the SPC guidelines and procedures, click here.</p>
  
  <h3>Some things to keep in mind</h3>
  
  <ul>
  <li>SPC's must have content that is distinct from any other course offering at the school</li>
  <li>Project mentors must be trained and qualified in the area to be studied</li>
  <li>A final reflective activity will be completed by the student to demonstrate learning</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If interested in the SPC or to register in the course, please contact Renee Harrison (<a href="http://mailto:renee.harrison@sunwestsd.ca">renee.harrison@sunwestsd.ca</a>) with questions, to receive the forms, and to submit the project proposal.</p>
