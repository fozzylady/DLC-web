  Equine 10L facilitates learning the basics of operation and care of horses. Learners will enhance
  their knowledge and gain confidence in the skills needed to take care of horses and their
  facilities. They will read, observe, research and carry out hands-on activities. Learners will
  create videos in order to demonstrate their skills. Due to the potential hazards when dealing with
  horses, learners must have an adult mentorâ€™s permission and willingness to supervise and guide
  their hands-on activities.
