description: |
  Math Foundations introduces different types of reasoning and expands a learner's understanding of statistics. Learners will study properties of angles and triangles and will learn to solve oblique triangles. We will also look at systems of linear inequalities and quadratic equations.
  
  Studying math improves logical reasoning, abstract thinking and reasoning, critical thinking, and system manipulation; these skills are often required by and ensure success in post-secondary institutions.
