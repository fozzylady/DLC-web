  Why do people behave the way they do? This is the central question behind this Social Psychology course.
  
  Learners will cover several of the prominent perspectives that attempt to explain behaviour, as well as the science behind studying people. They will discuss the ethics of research involving human beings as well as several particular experiments famous for their unethical treatments.
  
  Learners will examine four major aspects of every person's life - their physical reasons for behaviour, their emotional ones, as well as mental and spiritual reasons.
