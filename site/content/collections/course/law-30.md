delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
pre_requisite: none
description: |
  Learners will explore the Canadian legal system, from the early roots in British common law to the modern Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They will examine how, and why, Canadaâ€™s legal system developed. As part of this exploration, learners will develop a clear understanding and appreciation for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, not only knowing their rights as Canadians but why these rights are so significant.
  
  Criminal law is a major area of focus in Law 30. Learners will examine what makes a crime a crime, what is needed to convict someone of a crime, and how criminal court cases are tried in Canada. Throughout this, we will look at a number of current and historical legal cases to help us better understand the foundations of Canadian criminal law.
  
  Law 30 is both a Social Science and a Business course. It is with this dual focus that learners will examine civil law. This critical aspect of law is both important to us as citizens and as part of the business world. By understanding the law, a business can be better prepared not only to meet the needs of its customers but prevent costly litigation.
