title: Chemistry 30
description: ""
0: >
  Chemistry 30 will expand on the study of chemical properties and bonds and ask learners to
  investigate what makes materials suitable for use in specific household and industrial applications.
  We will also explore the nature of equilibrium in chemical reactions including solution chemistry
  and acid-base reactions. As we dive into the unit on electrochemistry, learners will explore
  oxidation-reduction reactions and the impact of electrochemistry on society and the environment.
