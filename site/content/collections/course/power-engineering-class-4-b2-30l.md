title: Power Engineering Class 4 B2 30L
delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
pre_requisite: '4th Class Power Engineering - B1, and students must be independent, organized, strong in math and science (think successful in Physics 30), and motivated.  The program is written at a post secondary level, but Sun West DLC teachers will provide supports to help high school students through the content.  Acceptance into the progam will rely on a principal endorsement (see below).'

  Sun West School Division, in partnership with Pan Global Training Systems Ltd., are proud to offer a unique learning opportunity for high school students. This program is designed to give students an opportunity to complete theoretical component of the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Class Power Engineer requirements for certification.</p>
  
  <p>There are four 100-hour courses associated with this program named A1, A2, B1, and B2. &nbsp;Successful completion of the Power Engineering A1, A2, B1, and B2 courses will grant you certification as a 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Class Power Engineer. Please note, however, that additional hands-on experience will be required in order to qualify you for work in the field. This practical component is known as “steam time.” Sun West is working with its partners to provide students access to steam time when the course requirements have been completed.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, to complete certification for 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Class Power Engineering in Saskatchewan, students must write and successfully pass two exams from the Technical Safety Authority of Saskatchewan (TSASK) at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tsask.ca/">http://www.tsask.ca/</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;The first exam will be written after A1 and A2 are complete. &nbsp;The second exam will follow the completion of B1 and B2. &nbsp;</p>
  
  <p><strong>The TSASK exam requires the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>student to pay a $108 fee each time an exam is written</strong>.&nbsp; This fee will&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>be covered by the division and must be covered by the student.&nbsp; In order to pass the TSASK exam&nbsp;<strong>the student must acquire at least 65%.</strong>&nbsp; If the exam is failed, the student must wait at least 30 days before they rewrite and must pay the fee again.</p>
  
  <p>TSASK holds four day-long Power Engineer exam sittings in both Regina and Saskatoon, four times throughout the year. There is an additional full day exam sitting offered in both the Spring and Fall. More information about the exam schedule and requirements are available on the TSASK home page.&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>The Sun West Power Engineering Course has been divided into four sections to make this course manageable for high school students:</p>
