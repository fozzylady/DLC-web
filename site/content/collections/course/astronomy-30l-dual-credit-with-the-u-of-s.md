  <p>Students will explore physical properties and orbital behavior of planets, moons, asteroids and comets as revealed by telescopic observations and spacecraft missions. They will learn how the scientific method changed our understanding of orbital motions within the solar system. Recent astronomical techniques for studying exoplanets orbiting other star systems will be investigated. Techniques for operating telescopes and analyzing astronomical data will be examined with online access to computer-simulated laboratories.&nbsp;</p>
