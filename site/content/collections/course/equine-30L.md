title: Equine 30L
delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
pre_requisite: None (Recommended to take Equine 10L first)
description: |
  Equine 30L facilitates learning about husbandry and systems involved in dealing with horses.
  
  Learners will enhance their knowledge and gain confidence in the skills and abilities needed to discuss basic equine reproduction, recognize and prevent common diseases in horses, offer basic first aid, and provide for more complex nutritional requirements. Learners will read, observe, research and carry out hands-on activities. Students will create videos in order to demonstrate course skills. Due to the potential hazards when dealing with horses, learners must have an adult mentorâ€™s permission and willingness to supervise and guide their hands-on activities.
  
  Learners in our agriculture courses will complete the OATS farm safety online program, developed by the Saskatchewan Safety Council.
