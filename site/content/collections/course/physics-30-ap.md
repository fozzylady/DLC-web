title: Physics 30 AP
delivery_method: Online Asynchronous
pre_requisite: >
  To achieve the high school credits associated with this course students must have obtained Science
  10; however, this course is rigorous (equivalent to a first year university course) and students
  must be highly motivated to succeed.Internet is required for this course.

It is also a fantastic college preparatory course. Since <strong>Physics 30 AP is taught over a full school year,</strong> there is time for thorough, in-depth, student centered activities allowing students to carry out careful experiments and design practical laboratory work to answer real world questions.</p>
  
  <p>Physics 30 AP ends with completing an exam (administered by the AP Board) that can be used to earn College credit (this depends on the institution and how you do on the exam). <b>More details about AP exams can be found in the General Advanced Placement (AP) Information below.</b></p>

  <h3>Credits Earned</h3>
  
  <p>Successful completion of this course will prepare you for the AP Physics 1 exam, to be written in May. After the exam there are two modules that must be completed to fully earn the Physical Science 20 and Physics 30 high school credits. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); line-height: 23px;">On your transcript, you will have an AP designation for Physics 30 if you&nbsp;attempt the AP exam in May; otherwise, you will recieve the regular Physics 30 credit. &nbsp;There is no AP designation for 20 level courses, so you will recieve the regular Physical Science 20 credit regardless of whether you attempt the exam or not. &nbsp;</span><strong><em>Other important details about Advanced Placement &nbsp;(AP)&nbsp;lie below the Course Description and Units of Study. &nbsp;All students considering AP should read all of these details.</em></strong></p>
