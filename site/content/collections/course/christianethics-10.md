description: |
  Christian Ethics 10 focuses on the life of Jesus, the heart of our identity as Christians. We are called to learn about Jesus and to be in a relationship with him, yet, how can this be possible? How can we encounter someone who lived two thousand years ago?
  
  Throughout this course, learners will study Jesus through the Gospels, through the society and history of the first century, through the history of the Church, and through their own lives.
