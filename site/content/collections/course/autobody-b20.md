description: |
  <P>Building on the knowledge gained in A20,  Autobody B20 exposes learners to automotive detailing, refinishing and repair.  We study specific components of a vehicle such as restraint, cooling, and air conditioning systems and learn how to properly maintain, assess damage and repair these parts.  Learners also gain a basic understanding of the time and cost associated with various autobody repairs.  There is always a continued emphasis on workplace safety practices. </p>
  
  
  <P>This course has a required work placement component (50 hours of theory and 50 hours of work placement).  The work placement must be coordinated through a Career Work Exploration (CWEX) teacher (ask your principal if you do not know if you have a CWEX teacher available). The work placement provides the student with hands-on experience in the autobody repair industry. Students are responsible for any necessary workplace attire/materials (ex. work boots, tools, etc).</p>
  
  <P>For Practical and Applied Arts (PAA) courses with a work placement, scheduled site visits by a CWEX teacher are required. <a href="/courses/paa-work-placement">Learn more about work placements.</a></p>
