title: Ag-Tech Cow/Calf 10
description: |
  Cow/Calf 10 is a part of the PAA curriculum and focuses on Cattle Care and Production. The course
  consists of 30-40 assignments, a Resource Binder final project, and hands-on skills. There is no
  final exam.

  Learners in our agriculture courses will complete the OATS farm safety online program, developed by
  the Saskatchewan Safety Council.

  Learners will prepare videos as they demonstrate their skills. Access to cattle and livestock
  facilities is necessary. Due to the seasonal nature of this course, we suggest that learners who
  register for Semester 1 allow all year for the course.
