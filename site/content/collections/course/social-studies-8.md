  <P>Social Studies is a required area of study in the Saskatchewan Curriculum. In Social 8, students will explore what it is to be Canadian.</p>
  
  <p>The purpose of social studies is to help learners know and appreciate the past, understand the present, influence the future, and make connections between events and issues of the past, the present, and the future. Social Studies education is the study of people and their relationships with the world around them.</p>
  
  <P>The Social Studies program provides opportunity for learners to develop a sense of themselves as active participants in their world (personal, local, national, and global). They are encouraged to make connections to their own lives as they learn.</p>
  
  <P>Lesson plans include written instruction, some instructional video, handouts and assessment tools. Learners will complete lessons and projects by reading, researching, and connecting. Assessment will include regular submissions to the DLC teacher. Submissions will include PDF documents and sometimes will include photos of projects. All work will be typed.</p>
