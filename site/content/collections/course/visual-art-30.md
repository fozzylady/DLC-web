  <P>Visual Art 30 is well suited to those with a passion for drawing, but we welcome learners of all abilities and degrees of experience.  We delve into art history, art appreciation and studio art and examine a number of works from both historical and cultural perspectives. We will also study the basics of drawing using two-dimensional, dry media such as drawing pencils, charcoal, and pencil crayons. </p>
