description: |
  Building on the basic skills developed in Drafting & CAD 10, learners will turn their focus to residential home design. They will learn to recognize and understand different types of planning documents such as floor plans, foundation plans, elevations, and 3D drawings. Understanding the types, uses, and typical locations of specific building materials, learners will create architectural drawings for homes of their choosing.
  
  As with all forms of engineering, computer-aided design requires a great degree of precision and accuracy. As learners move through the Drafting & CAD strand of courses, expectations for precise work will intensify along with the complexity of the tasks tackled.
