  In Astronomy 20 we will take a journey through the universe to explore everything from the potential for extraterrestrial life to the evolution of stars and galaxies. This course explores deep questions about the universe from a scientific perspective such as, "What is the origin of life?", "How do stars form and die?", and "What is the fate of the universe?".
  
  Learners will have the opportunity to navigate across the night sky to locate constellations, planets and other celestial objects. The DLC will send you a telescope kit, which you will assemble, and use to locate celestial objects in the night sky. Computer software will be used throughout the course for modelling astronomical phenomena.
