  Entrepreneurship 30 is designed to incite a sense of enthusiasm for innovation and spur creative thinking about entrepreneurial possibilities in your future.

They will learn about the characteristics and habits of successful entrepreneurs and, with the creation of a personal profile, reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses, exploring how they might serve us as entrepreneurs.
