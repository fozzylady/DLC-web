  Equine 20L facilitates learning the processes and practices involved in dealing with horses.
  
  Learners will enhance their knowledge and gain confidence in the skills and abilities needed to maintain outdoor equine environments, apply business management skills, manage tack and equipment, communicate and interact professionally, and display a positive attitude toward equine and personal safety. They will read, observe, research and carry out hands-on activities.
  
  Learners will create videos in order to demonstrate their skills. Due to the potential hazards when dealing with horses, learners must have an adult mentorâ€™s permission and willingness to supervise and guide their hands-on activities.
  
  Learners in our agriculture courses will complete the OATS farm safety online program, developed by the Saskatchewan Safety Council.
