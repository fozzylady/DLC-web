<p>Kenaston School was alive with the sights and sounds of creativity in action onMonday,October 3rd. Twenty-four children from home-based learning environments joined Kenaston elementary students for theSunWest Distance LearningCentre's first ever ArtsEducationWorkshop. As they moved from class room to classroom, the students were immersed in a variety of independent and collaborative scenarios where they were encouraged to channel their creativity into story, song and dance. Professional artists from theSaskatchewan Cultural Exchange were on hand to lead these sessions, inspiring the youth with their experiences and energy.
