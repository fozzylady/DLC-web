<p>Want to recover or pick up extra high school credits this summer?
</p>
<p>DLC Summer School
</p>
<p>Running six weeks from July 4th to August 15th, DLC Summer School provides an opportunity to lightenyour load in the fall or get back on track if you feel you are falling behind.
</p>
<p>We offer a limited number of our regular classes but the course itself remains the same. Summer School courses may or may not be taught by the same instructor that delivers the course during the regular school year, but whoever is teaching it, is available each school day via email, phone and video conference to support you.
</p>
<p>Like all other DLCcourses, Summer School courses cost $500 (unless registered as a full time student with Sun West School Division).
