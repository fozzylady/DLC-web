<p>As winter made an appearance early this year, DLC students in our various
agriculture-based courses needed to get creative in tackling the hands-on
portion of their study. In each of our Cow/Calf, Equine and Field Crop Studies
courses, there is an online, theoretical element and a practical, in-the-field
component. Course assessment is based on a combination of written
assignments, video submissions, and a comprehensive resource manual that
the student compiles throughout his/her course

<h2>Student Leadership on a
National Platform
<br></h2>
<p>According to DLC teacher Kristin Sampson, the DLC couldn't
have been better represented at the Canadian Student
Leadership Conference (CSLC) in Edmunston, New Brunswick
last month.
Sampson accompanied three DLC students to the week long
conference where they interacted with over 1,000 delegates
from across the country.
